# Laos-Tourism-Website

Part 1: Static version of the website, hardcoded HTML and CSS data.
Part 2: Redeveloped version of part 1 to create a dynamic website. Used PHP/SQL to store the data in the database and used SQL SELECT statements to retrieve this information.

Live Website (part 1): https://people.rit.edu/~ak5297/iste240/project1/home.php

This is my final project for my website development course. I created a website for tourism in Laos.

The focus was on using PHP and Javascript. PHP was used to store form data to my database and Javascipt was used for user validation in the form.
