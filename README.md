# Laos-Tourism-Website

Live Website: https://people.rit.edu/~ak5297/iste240/project1/home.php

This is my final project for my website development course. I created a website for tourism in Laos.

The focus was on using PHP and Javascript. PHP was used to store form data to my database and Javascipt was used for user validation in the form.
