<h1>About The Site</h1>
</div>


<p> 
This page was created as part of the Individual Midterm Project for the ISTE-240 - Web and Mobile II course.
I chose this country because this is where my parents are originally from, and I had the opportunity to visit and
see all that is mentioned on this site. I want people to know about this small country because most people have 
no idea where Laos is. The outcome of the site is to create exposure and interest people to visit the country.

<h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<p>
Hello! My name is Alex Ketavongsa, I'm 21 years old and I was born in Rochester, NY. I am the oldest child of 3
with a younger sister and brother. My interests include hiking, video games, and traveling. I received my 
Associates degree in Computer Systems Technology at Monroe Community College in May 2018. Before I came to RIT
, I developed a strong interest in web and app development which got me into the Web & Mobile Computing major.
In the future, I want to use my skills to obtain a position as a Front End Developer.
