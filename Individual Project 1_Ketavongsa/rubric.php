<h1>Grading Criteria (Grading Rubric) -You will be graded on:</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">

<h3>o Good Design Techniques – CRAP. Alt and title attributes for each image</h3>
<ul>
<li>The alignment of pictures and text took some time, they are placed in logical order and have good amount of spacing. The contrast of the pages are good, it is easy on the eye and the headings stands out. There is repetition on each page, following the same layout, font and color. The alignment of the pages makes the text easy to read. I have a content box in the center of each page so there is margin space between the body text. Proximity is displayed by the captions below each of the images giving a brief description for that image.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>o Organization of information – text and graphics make sense – logical – use the CSS float property for some images.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used float on almost all of the images. I wanted to make the pages "flow" so I alternated the float between left and right. That makes the pages more interesting by not having the images all on one side. The organization of my content makes sense. The pages only discuss what is relevant to that topic. My navigation bar is listed in logical order, starting from the history page and ending with the feedback page.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>o Content – interesting read, excellent grammar, perfect spelling.  Please do not make the content of text on the inside pages short.  Try to keep the first page (index) to one screen, no scroll bars.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I wrote about Laos in great detail. There is a a lot of information for someone to learn more about the country. The homepage is really brief and has no scrollbar, it welcomes the visitor to the site and displays some images in a slideshow. The grammar and spelling has been proofread and is free of mistakes.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>o Navigation – easy to get around, intuitive, well labeled</h3>
<ul>
<li>The navigation bar is simple and is well labeled. The button for the page that the visitor is currently on is filled in, making it easy to know which page the user is on. On mobile, there is a hamburger menu that makes it easy to navigate as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>o Use of HTML5 and CSS3 (both text and positioning) Valid HTML 5 and Valid CSS3 – Remember to use the validators demonstrated in class</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used HTML5 and CSS3 extensively throughout this project. All of my pages passed validation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>o You must have some JavaScript.  The JavaScript must have a clear purpose and benefit your site.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used Javascript on this site to create my image slideshow and to validate my form. The image slideshow makes the page have less clutter, by automatically cycling through the photos. The validation for my form prevents visitors from not entering required values.</li>
</ul>

<h3>o That you modified your exercise 4 and included it in this project and made the form submit button work to send the forms contents to multiple email addresses.  Modify exercise 4 from when you submitted it previously.  Change the background color, logo, and the radio button content to relate to this project – the place you visited.  Also when you update exercise 4 for this project make sure this form has working links to all the pages of this project!</h3>
<ul>
<li>I modified my Exercise 4 to match the specifications of this project. The questions and options on the survey match the topics discussed on my site and uses PHP to send user input to multiple email addresses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>o A separate linked "Reference" page. You will lose 25% for not having a "References" page. Follow my sample provided in this specification.  You can use an HTML table in this page.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have a references page that lists all borrowed content and images. This is listed in a table with the source URL, date updated, location used on my site, and the photo/logo.</li>
</ul>
