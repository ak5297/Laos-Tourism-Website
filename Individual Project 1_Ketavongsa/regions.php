<h2>Luang Prabang</h2>
<p>
This small town encircled by mountains and greenery is called Luang Prabang, the former capital of Laos. In 1545, King Phothisarat moved
the administrative seat to Vientiane. The city was designated a UNESCO World Heritage city since 1995. This distinction was awarded because the city 
reflects the fusion of Lao and European architecture and the townscape is well preserved. 
While strolling around the city, you may notice that the buildings combines the traditional Lao wooden houses with some European architecture.
This influence goes back to when Laos was a French colony. It is a relatively small city with the Nam Khan and Mekong Rivers surrounding almost the 
entire city. You can find anything from former royal palaces to over 33 temples since the city remains the main center for Buddhist learning
in Laos. Thanks to its geographical location, it can be considered an adventurer's paradise. There are waterfalls, mountain peaks, and rivers 
providing endless opportunities to enjoy all Luang Prabang has to offer.

<h2>Vientiane</h2>
<p>
The capital city, Vientiane, is located in this region. The city sits right on the border with Northern Thailand divided by the
Mekong River. It is known as one of the quietest capital cities in Southeast Asia. It is pronounced "Wiang Jan" and translates roughly to
the "City of Sandalwood". The city has a small-town atmosphere to it, and two days is enough to see sights around the city. There is a piece of history
around every corner, from the several temples such as Pha That Loung to the popular Patuxai monument. If you prefer nightlife, there are several 
bars and pubs in the downtown area. One of the most memorable experiences is shopping at the "talat" or market. There is the morning market open 
daily from 7AM-6PM. It is located inside the only mall in Laos. You can find street vendors that sell items from freshly baked baguettes to 
traditional Laotian clothing. From 6PM to 11PM, the night market is open by the riverside. This market is aimed towards tourists, and you can find 
souvenirs items such as Beer Lao t-shirts and Buddhist-inspired knickknacks.

<h2>Vang Vieng</h2>
<p>
About a 3 hour drive north of Vientiane, lies the beautiful riverside town of Vang Vieng. Known for its picturesque landscape and nightlife,
this town is a popular stop with backpackers. It is well known for tubing along the Mekong River, where you can float by restaurants and bars, 
referred to as "TV Bars", that play re-runs of Friends and Family Guy episodes. The majority of the bars have been shut down by the government 
due to "dangerous excessive partying" resulting in the death of 27 tourists. As of February 2016, there were just 2 bars still open. The town isn't
all about partying - it offers a vast amount of outdoor activities as well. There are tour companies that offer cave visits, kayaking, ziplines, 
swimming in water falls, and dirt buggies.

<h2>Si Phan Don</h2>

<p>
Would you have ever guessed that Laos has islands? Get your sunglasses and sunblock ready because the next location is Si Phan Don! 
The name literally means "4 Thousand Islands" in Laotian. While there are 4000 islands, only two of them are most visited: Don Dhet and Don Khong.
The rest are uninhabited due to their small size. Don Dhet is the most laid back island while Don Khong is the biggest and busiest island. You can find
Irrawaddy dolphin and plenty of fish in the water surrounding the islands. The dolphins are best spotted from the south of the islands
from December until May towards the end of the day. Boat tours are available as well. The islands are really secluded and there are only basic accommodations, so 
don't expect phones or electricity! Locals are self-sufficient and rely on local produce such as rice, fish, coconut, and sugar cane. Clothing is made
by their own weaving techniques. It really is an escape from the real world.
