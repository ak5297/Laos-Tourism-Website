<h1>Kuang Si Waterfalls</h1>
</div>

<p>Hidden inside the lush jungles of Luang Prabang is the Kuang Si Waterfalls. This landmark is extremely underrated
but is becoming overrun by tourists every year. The water is turquoise blue and clear making it a perfect place to
relax and take beautiful photos. The best spot to go is at the "secret pool" at the top of the waterfall
which overlooks the entire jungle. Also, there are ropes from trees that let you swing into the water. As you leave,
stop by the Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Center and admire the Asiatic Black Bears that have been rescued from 
dangerous conditions. The bears' habitat include hammocks, pools, and play areas to keep them entertained.</p>

<h1>Plain of Jars</h1>
</div>

<p>
If you want to see the Stonehenge's sister, you need to visit the Plain of Jars. Located in Xiangkhouang, these large
stone jars are made from rock ranging 3 to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 14 tons. The origins of the jars are 
unknown but archaeologists believe it was used 1,000 to 2,000 years ago. Researches believe that it was used for
funeral urns or food storage. It is also home to thousands of unexploded bombs from The Secret War that are scattered 
in the area. Tourists can visit 3 different sites that have already been cleared of the bombs. You can find 
tourists sitting on top of the jars while taking photos. Site 1 is the most popular being closest to the city and 
having a small museum. Site 2 has a hiking trail that leads through a forest.

<h1>Pha That Luang Temple</h1>
</div>

<p>
Pha That Luang is perhaps the most elegant-looking monument in Vientiane. The architecture is influenced by 
Buddhism and has several small stupas. The whole temple is painted in gold and is built on 3 levels. The levels 
represent the distance from Earth to heaven. The first level signifies the underworld, second level is the 30 
perfections of Buddhism, and third level is the gates to heaven. Since it is a temple, tourists should be 
considerate in how they dress as to not offend the locals. It is the perfect place to just meditate or 
to learn about how Buddhism influenced Laos.
