<h1>Religion + Baci Ceremony</h1>
</div>

<p>
The majority of Laotians are Buddhists, this is evident by the Pha That Luang being the national symbol of the country. The Pha That Luang is a gilded
stupa temple located in Vientiane. There is also some influences of animism as well. There is a traditional ceremony called "baci" that is held
before significant events to bind the 32 guardian spirits to a person's body. Significant events can be a marriage, the birth of a child, 
a serious illness, or before leaving on a long trip. The baci ceremony is simply held to bring good luck and fortune to the person.

<h1>How is the baci ceremony celebrated?</h1>
</div>

<h2>Before The Ceremony</h2>

<p>
Elderly women in the community prepare the "Pha Khuan" which is a marigold pyramid that contains yellow/white flowers, 
white cotton threads, small candles, cooked sticky rice, boiled eggs and little treats. There is also "Maak Beng" which is folded banana leaves where 
small candles tied onto a stick is placed into. The white cotton threads are cut around 10 inches long, enough to tie on a person's wrist, and
tied onto sticks that are stuck into the Maak Beng. The Maak Beng is then placed onto a big round silver tray. Rice is put on the base of the tray 
to keep it stable and treats such as fruits and boiled eggs surround the Maak Beng. Finally, the finished Pha Khuan is placed on a white cloth
in the center of the room for the ceremony. The dress code is modest - women should wear the traditional "sinh" and men should wear a collared shirt
with long sleeve pants.

<h2>During The Ceremony</h2>
<p>
The baci is performed by an older male who is usually, or has been, a monk. Everyone sits on the floor facing the Pha Khuan while the person
performing the baci chants in an ancient Sanskrit language. While this is happening, everyone has their palms held together in a position that is 
called "nop". People that sit closer to the Pha Khuan may be holding the white strings from the Pha Khuan between their palms. Near the end of the 
ceremony, people that sit in the front reach forward to touch the Pha Khuan. Those that can't reach it put their hand on the person in front of them
to get some of the "luck". Finally, the white strings from the Pha Khuan are cut into small strips that are used to tie on people's wrists while 
wishing them well. In one hand, you hold onto a treat from the tray while the string is being tied. Afterwards, make sure you "nop" to 
show appreciation. The strings should be worn for at least 3 days. There is usually a party held afterwards, with music and plenty of food. 
It is expected that attendees stay for a little bit to socialize.

<h1>Lao New Year</h1>
</div>

<p>
Lao New Year, or Bun Pi Mai, is celebrated annually in April and spans over three days. This occurs during the hot season and is a perfect time 
to visit the country. The festivities relate back to Buddhism and Animism with the belief that one's old spirit leaves this world, therefore
making room for a new one. On the first day of Pi Mai, it is considered the last day of the old year. Lao people clean their houses and prepare 
water, perfume, and flowers for the upcoming days. On the second day, it is considered a "day of no day" meaning it is not part of the old year
or part of the new year. The third day is when Lao New Year officially starts, locals will go "tak baht" which means giving alms to monks, go to
baci ceremonies, and soak each other in water! That's right, no matter where you go people will dump buckets of water or spray you with their 
water guns!
